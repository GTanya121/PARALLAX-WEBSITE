        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>The Mughal dynasty practically came to an end when in 1803, the native rulers defeated by General Lake of
            East India Company near Patparganj. The East India appointed first resident of Delhi as the 'Protector' of
            battered Mughal crown. In the early years the British and their troops settled within the walled city around
            the Red Fort and Kashmere Gate. The city underwent drastic transformations after the war of 1857. One third
            of the city was razed to rubble in 1858 and the East India Company transferred the rule to the British
            Crown.
            On 12th December, 1911, at the historic Delhi Durbar, the George V, the Emperor of the British Empire
            proclaimed the shifting of the capital of India from Calcutta to Delhi. After announcement of Delhi as the
            Capital of India, the preparation for the building a new city started with majesty, pomp and show. Thus came
            up a vary special city, New Delhi, the dream of Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, city planners and
            architects. Built on the area in and around Raisina Hills, the new city housed among the landmarks, the
            Rastrapathi Bhawan, (Viceroy's House), the North and South Blocks of the Secretariat, and a Council Chamber
            which now houses India's Parliament, the 42 meters high memorial arch India Gate, Cannought Place and
            numerous roads, parks and other structures.</p>

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway in the middle
            of a
            crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost
            their lives
            fighting for the British Army during the World War I. The memorial bears the names of more than 13,516
            British and
            Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919.
            The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was
            designed by
            Edwin Lutyens. The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin.
            Another
            memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was added much later, after India got its independence. The eternal flame burns
            day and night
            under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of
            December 1971.
            The entire arch stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge moulding. The
            cornice is
            inscribed with the Imperial suns while both sides of the arch have INDIA, flanked by the dates MCMXIV (1914
            left) and
            MCMXIX (1919 right). The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with burning oil on
            anniversaries but this is rarely done.
            During nightfall, India Gate is dramatically floodlit while the fountains nearby make a lovely display with
            coloured lights. India Gate stands at one end of Rajpath, and the area surrounding it is generally referred to as
            'India Gate'.</p>

        <p>The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Bahá’í House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986,
            costing $10 million. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city.
            Like all Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other
            qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad “petals” arranged in clusters of
            three to form nine sides, with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 40
            metres and a capacity of 2,500 people. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been
            featured in many newspaper and magazine articles. A 2001 CNN report referred to it as the most visited
            building in the world.</p>

        <p>The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal
            Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an
            older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The
            private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the
            Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity
            which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based
            on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building,
            reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort’s innovative planning and
            architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in
            Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.</p>
